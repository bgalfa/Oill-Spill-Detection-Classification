Created a simple model on Ocean Oil Spill Detection using Convolution Neural Networks.
The project is created for research purposes, where the dataset is trained and tested on multiple models each with aa different activation function.
The performance metrics of validation on each model has also been plotted.
Following Dataset has been: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vighneshanand/oil-spill-dataset-binary-image-classification".
